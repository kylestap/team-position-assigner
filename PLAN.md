🧩 Team Position Assigner Web App – Master Project Plan

🎯 Project Objective
  Develop a Flask-based web application that allows users to manage a soccer team roster, assign players to positions, and ensure gender balance on the field. 
  The app should have a user-friendly interface, visual display of player positions, and be deployed online for easy access and sharing.

📌 Project Approach & Workflow
  I will follow an iterative, test-driven approach. Key priorities will be:
  Build minimal working features early.
  Test frequently and adjust based on outcomes.
  Add complexity only after foundational features are stable.

⚠️ Anticipated Challenges & Strategies
Challenge	                                                                                       Anticipated Solution
Ensuring fair player assignments and gender balance	                                             Implement robust assignment logic with retries and fallback checks. Test with various player combinations.
Deployment errors (e.g., Render port binding, missing packages)	                                 Research platform-specific requirements, ensure correct Procfile and requirements.txt setup.
GitHub integration and repo syncing	                                                             Use Git CLI from the start, link local project early, and commit regularly.
Learning curve with HTML templates and visual layout	                                           Keep HTML minimal early, improve styling after logic is stable. Use grid layout for position display.

🛠️ Project Task Breakdown
  Phase 1: 🧱 Project Setup & Environment (Day 1)
     Set up local Python environment (virtualenv)
     Create Flask app (app.py)
     Install dependencies (Flask)
     Initialize SQLite database (team.db)
     Create GitHub repo and connect local project
     Add .gitignore and initial README.md

  Phase 2: 🧍 Player Management (Day 2)
    Create routes to:
      Add a new player (with 3 preferred positions + gender)
      View the full roster
      Edit and delete players
      Store data in SQLite
      Validate forms and sanitize inputs

Phase 3: 🧠 Team Assignment Logic (Day 3–4)
  Build logic to:
    Assign 7 players to 7 positions (GK, LB, RB, LW, RW, CM, Striker)
    Respect preferred positions in priority order
    Ensure exactly 3–4 female and 3–4 male players
    Prevent duplicate assignments
    Shuffle + retry assignment logic if not all positions are filled
    Display bench players

Phase 4: 🖼️ Visual Field Layout (Day 4–5)
  Create simple half-field layout using CSS grid
  Display players at their assigned positions
  Style positions for clarity (e.g., box borders, labels)
  Add “Back” and “Home” buttons for navigation

Phase 5: 🧪 Testing (Day 5)
  Write test script test_app.py to:
  Validate player creation and editing
  Test assignment logic (unique positions, gender balance)
  Check error handling
  Run and debug all failing tests

Phase 6: 🚀 Deployment (Day 6)
  Create requirements.txt with dependencies
  Add Procfile for Render
  Push code to GitHub
  Deploy to Render.com
  Handle Render-specific errors:
    Port binding (0.0.0.0)
    Missing gunicorn dependency
  Confirm working public URL

Phase 7: 📄 Documentation (Day 6–7)
  Write detailed README.md with:
  Project description
  Setup instructions
  Deployment guide
  Troubleshooting notes
  
Push updates to GitHub

🗓️ Suggested Timeline (7-Day Sprint)
Day	Focus Area
Day 1	Project setup, Flask scaffold, DB init, GitHub connection
Day 2	Roster CRUD functionality
Day 3	Position assignment logic (basic)
Day 4	Assignment retry logic + gender rules
Day 5	Field layout visuals, complete testing
Day 6	Deployment to Render, fix deployment bugs
Day 7	Final README, polish UI, test live app
